# Earthquake analysis
## Description
In this project, I am doing an exploratory data analysis about earthquakes that happened in Greece, from 1901 to 2018. The aim of this project is 
* Find insights about the most seismogenic country (i.e. country where many earthquakes occure) of Europe, Greece
* Use interactive dashboards in order to visualize my data

## Dash
For the interactive dashboard see here

## The story
Greece is one of the most earthquake prone countries in the world. Hence, we make a proposion for an **information campaign**, using data to analyze the history of earthquakes from the beginning of the previous century.
Some questions that will be answered and can be found in the **presentation** folder are:
* Years with most observed earthquakes
* Number of earthquakes with magnitude at least 5 Richter
* Map with places where strong earthquakes occured after 1970
* Foreshocks (In which order does the strongest earthquake occure?)
* Aftershocks (Magnitude difference between strongest earthquake and strongest aftershock)
