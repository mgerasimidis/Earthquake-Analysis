# Earthquakes in Greece analysis
Data analysis for earthquakes that happened in Greece from 1901 to 2018. Main purpose of this project was, besides the analysis of the data, to use interactive dashboards and maps.
### Main Modules used
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Folium

### Contents
#### Analysis part I
General exploratory analysis about all the earthquakes in Greece (from 1901 to 2018).
#### Analysis part II
Analysis of earthquakes with at least 5 Richter magnitude.
#### Foreshocks and Aftershocks
Considered cases where for a specific place, more than 3 earthquakes occured in a specific day. The goal was to answer:
* After how many foreshocks does the strongest earthquake occure?
* Is it correct that if the strongest earthquake happens, then we are safe?

### Insights
Please see the **presentation** folder, where I did a 5 min talk presentation about the results of my analysis.
